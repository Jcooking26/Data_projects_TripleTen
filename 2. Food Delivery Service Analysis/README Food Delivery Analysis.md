## Overview 
Executives at a food delivery company are interested in factors that affect delivery time. The food delivery data source provides data points for each delivery trip.

## Data points
* distance traveled
* traffic conditions
* driver age
* delivery hour
* driver rating
* weather conditions 
* order type
* Area type

## Considerations 
* Distance Values are calculated using food pickup and drop-off longitude and latitude coordinates.
* Distance values do not represent actual distance traveled.
* Values are straight line distances from restaurant to delivery location.
* Only trips where one delivery was made are used for analysis.
* Provides better distance to time relation.

## Collection Recommendations
* Have dispatch team record actual distance traveled for each delivery trip.
* Provides accurate travel distance for trips having multiple deliveries.
* Provides actual distance traveled instead of the mile radius.

## Notable Observations
* Delivery time and trip distance best in urban areas. Shorter trips & Faster Deliveries
	* Recommendation – Increase marketing/business activities in urban areas. 
    * Recommendation – Target and gain more close-range customers.
* 44% of all trips are 20-30min range 
* Delivery time increases with traffic density.
* Deliveries for drivers over 30 take 5 minutes longer.
    * Recommendation – Identify what’s slowing down older drivers. Provide additional training. For example, drivers with high delivery times are invited to a technology training. 
* Delivery order volume increases around 5pm and continues through the night. 
* Longest delivery times are between 8pm and 9pm
* Drivers with ratings over 4.5 complete deliveries 9 minutes faster than lower rated drivers. 
* Adverse weather conditions increase delivery time.
